Waze
￼
Project goal:  
Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.
Background: 
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. 
Scenario: 
You are the newest member of Waze’s data team. Your team is about to begin their user churn project. The first step is to create a project proposal. The proposal will clearly define the overall goal of the project, and identify key tasks, milestones, and stakeholders. 
Course 1 tasks:
* Assign PACE stages to the requested tasks for the user churn project
* Organize tasks into milestones
* Create a project proposal for the Waze data team

Background on the Waze scenario
Welcome to your new role at Waze! We’re thrilled to have you on the data team! 
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely. 
You’ll collaborate with your Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. In your role, you will analyze user data and develop a machine learning model that predicts user churn. 
This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 
* Who are the users most likely to churn?
* Why do users churn? 
* When do users churn? 
For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may simply lose these users without knowing why. 
Your insights will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.  
Project background

* A project proposal identifying the following:
    * Organize project tasks into milestones
    * Classify tasks using the PACE workflow
    * Identify relevant stakeholders
